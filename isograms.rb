#   Isograms
# An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
#
# is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
# is_isogram("aba" ) == false
# is_isogram("moOse" ) == false # -- ignore letter case
